My algorithm required that I convert visitationHours to an object with start and end timestamps just like in scheduledCalls. The trade-off I made was to skip converting the visitationHours; instead I hard-corded it.
If I had more time, I would convert the visitationHours accordingly. I would also work on the correctness of the checkIfScheduledCallIsInAvailableTimeSlot function.
